Morty is an open source platform for managing serverless functions. It is mainly written in Go, and use under the hood our cloud orchestrator, [RIK](https://github.com/rik-org/rik) to manage microVM instances where the functions will be executed.

## Features

- **Manage functions in a simple way**: With the official [Morty CLI](https://github.com/morty-faas/cli), you can create as many functions as you want. In 3 commands, you will be able to invoke your first function in a blazingly fast time.

- **Native support for various runtimes**: You like to code serverless functions in `NodeJS`, `Go`, `Rust` or `Python` ? Morty has native support for them. If you wish to develop functions in another runtime, you can open an issue in the [runtimes repository](https://github.com/morty-faas/runtimes).
  
- **Community driven**: Morty is an open-source project and contributions are highly appreciated. You need to ask a question, you want to make a proposal for a new feature or you want to fix a bug ? Don&apos;t hesitate to do it on GitHub ! [Learn more about our contribution process](#contributing).
